I am José Miguel González Aguilera, Senior Engineer and
Degree in Economics. In this blog I publish those topics
that interest me and, to the extent that the work allows me, I can
develop. I try to tell things about Information Technology.

I like finding simple and elegant solutions to problems,
although simple, it is never easy.


My qualifications and experience can be checked in my [linkedin profile](http://es.linkedin.com/in/jose-miguel-gonzalez-aguilera-a727b010).

I am at your disposal in the e-mail and social networks listed
at the end of the page.

Greetings and welcome to my web.
