*Finally, I completed my translation of this book!*

I started in 2009, after I completed the translation of [Snake Wrangling for Kids](https://github.com/jmgaguilera/swfk-es/releases). Mark Pilgrim published online an new version of [his famous book, now about Python 3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/), so, after talking to him, I started the translation.

Circunstances of life, personal and work related, I stopped the translation at chapter fourteen. The two final chapters and four appendices were missing... And all the effort in revision and format edition.

Last may, I took *LaTeX* code of the translation, changed it from mercurial to git, and I migrated it to *XeLaTeX*.

And now! At the end of holiday, I completed translation and edition. And, as a complement, I generated a HTML version. 

* **PDF**: [http://github.com/jmgaguilera/inmersionenpython3/releases](http://github.com/jmgaguilera/inmersionenpython3/releases)
* **HTML**: [http://www.jmgaguilera.com/inmersionenpython3html](http://www.jmgaguilera.com/inmersionenpython3html)
* Código **LaTeX**: [http://github.com/jmgaguilera/inmersionenpython3](https://github.com/jmgaguilera/inmersionenpython3)


I hope this translantion will facilitate the learning of this elegant, dinamic, object oriented language to Spanish-speaking people. I appreciate your feedback if you find mistakes I can correct.
