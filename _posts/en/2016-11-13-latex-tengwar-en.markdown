I have written an article for the LaTeX wikibook in Spanish with the different alternatives to use the Tengwar writing system of J.R.R. Tolkien with LaTeX.
A tribute to the author of the Lord of the Rings, book that I have read again thanks to the new limited edition of 5,000 copies of Minotauro. By the way, my copy is number 287 &#128522;.

The Tengwar writing system is the most developed that Tolkien designed, but not the only one. This is what many people call "Elvish", but it is not. Actually, in the world of Tolkien there are several Elvish languages, and can be written in alphabetic writing and in "invented" writing systems such as Tengwar.

Tengwar, besides being the most developed, is the most famous for being used in ring inscription.
