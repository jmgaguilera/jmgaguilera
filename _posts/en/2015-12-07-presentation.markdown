Hello,

I am José Miguel González Aguilera, Senior Engineer and
Degree in Economics. I expect to publish in this blog issues that are 
of interest to me, and that I hope they are of interest for those who read this
blog.

I will develop mainly estrategic issues about Technologies
of Information and Communication, which I have experience, but I will publish 
other posts more technical and more fun.

Greetings and welcome.
