<h1 id="David-Bowie-II-(buscando-canciones-similares)">David Bowie II (classifying his songs)</h1><p>last article in my blog was dedicated to <a href="http://www.jmgaguilera.com/an%C3%A1lisis/2016/01/24/david-bowie.html">David Bowie</a>.</p>
<p>I want to extend it searching relationships in his songs using as a features just his lyrics. Using ununstructured text analysis tools to find the <em>distance</em> between songs <span class="as"></span><span class="br">(</span><span class="mar">I will use Euclidean distances</span><span class="br">)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="Antecedentes">Background</h2>

<p>We have lyrics of 254 songs.</p>
<p> Like in last article, we have to convert lyrics to terms, discarding, if possible, the differences between plurals and verbs.</p>

<h2 id="T&#233;rminos">T&#233;rminos</h2>

<p>First of all, we create a word list to discard. Articles, pronoums, ...</p>
<blockquote>i, me, my, myself, we, our, ours, ourselves, you, your, yours, yourself, yourselves, he, him, his, himself, she, her, hers, herself, it, its, itself, they, them, their, theirs, themselves, what, which, who, whom, this, that, these, those, am, is, are, was, were, be, been, being, have, has, had, having, do, does, did, doing, a, an, the, and, but, if, or, because, as, until, while, of, at, by, for, with, about, against, between, into, through, during, before, after, above, below, to, from, up, down, in, out, on, off, over, under, again, further, then, once, here, there, when, where, why, how, all, any, both, each, few, more, most, other, some, such, no, nor, not, only, own, same, so, than, too, very, s, t, can, will, just, don, should, now, d, ll, m, o, re, ve, y, ain, aren, couldn, didn, doesn, hadn, hasn, haven, isn, ma, mightn, mustn, needn, shan, shouldn, wasn, weren, won, wouldn, chorus, 'm, 's, 'll, n't, 'd, ca, wo, oh, yeah, x2.</blockquote>

</div>
</div>

<div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered">
<div class="inner_cell">
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>Then we tokenize al lyrics, e.g., <b>Blackstar</b> lyrics:</p>
<blockquote>in the villa of ormen in the villa of ormen stands a solitary candle ah-ah ah-ah in the centre of it all in the centre of it all your eyes on the day of execution on the day of execution only women kneel and smile ah-ah ah-ah at the centre of it all at the centre of it all your eyes your eyes ah-ah-ah ah-ah-ah in the villa of ormen in the villa of ormen stands a solitary candle ah-ah ah-ah in the centre of it all in the centre of it all your eyes ah-ah-ah something happened on the day he died spirit rose a metre and stepped aside somebody else took his place and bravely cried i’m a blackstar i’m a blackstar how many times does an angel fall how many people lie instead of talking tall he trod on sacred ground he cried loud into the crowd i’m a blackstar i’m a blackstar i’m not a gangster i can’t answer why i’m a blackstar just go with me i’m not a filmstar i’m-a take you home i’m a blackstar take your passport and shoes i’m not a popstar and your sedatives boo i’m a blackstar you’re a flash in the pan i’m not a marvel star i’m the great i am i’m a blackstar i’m a blackstar way up oh honey i’ve got game i see right so white so open-heart it’s pain i want eagles in my daydreams diamonds in my eyes i’m a blackstar i’m a blackstar something happened on the day he died spirit rose a metre and stepped aside somebody else took his place and bravely cried i’m a blackstar i’m a star star i’m a blackstar i can’t answer why i’m not a gangster but i can tell you how i’m not a flam star we were born upside-down i’m a star star born the wrong way ‘round i’m not a white star i’m a blackstar i’m not a gangster i’m a blackstar i’m a blackstar i’m not a pornstar i’m not a wandering star i’m a blackstar i’m a blackstar in the villa of ormen stands a solitary candle ah-ah ah-ah at the centre of it all your eyes on the day of execution only women kneel and smile ah-ah ah-ah at the centre of it all your eyes your eyes ah-ah-ah</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now we supress diferences between similar words, discarded words, etc. e.g. <b>Blackstar</b>:</p>

<blockquote>villa ormen villa ormen stand solitari candl ah-ah ah-ah centr centr eye day execut day execut women kneel smile ah-ah ah-ah centr centr eye eye ah-ah-ah ah-ah-ah villa ormen villa ormen stand solitari candl ah-ah ah-ah centr centr eye ah-ah-ah someth happen day die spirit rose metr step asid somebodi els took place brave cri i'm blackstar i'm blackstar mani time angel fall mani peopl lie instead talk tall trod sacr ground cri loud crowd i'm blackstar i'm blackstar i'm gangster can't answer i'm blackstar go i'm filmstar i'm-a take home i'm blackstar take passport shoe i'm popstar sedat boo i'm blackstar you'r flash pan i'm marvel star i'm great i'm blackstar i'm blackstar way honey i'v got game see right white open-heart it pain want eagl daydream diamond eye i'm blackstar i'm blackstar someth happen day die spirit rose metr step asid somebodi els took place brave cri i'm blackstar i'm star star i'm blackstar can't answer i'm gangster tell i'm flam star born upside-down i'm star star born wrong way round i'm white star i'm blackstar i'm gangster i'm blackstar i'm blackstar i'm pornstar i'm wander star i'm blackstar i'm blackstar villa ormen stand solitari candl ah-ah ah-ah centr eye day execut women kneel smile ah-ah ah-ah centr eye eye ah-ah-ah </blockquote>


<p>We do this with all lyrics. At the end we select the list of more frequent words. We will measure the distance between songs using de frequency of words. These are the 30 most frequent words:</p>

<p>Now we generate the distance matrix between songs from the matrix of frequencies of terms and documents. With this distance matrix clusterize songs using the <em> ward </em> method, to form a tree that allows you to see the potential clusters.</p>

<p>Como hay demasiadas canciones, cuesta distinguirlas en un árbol tan denso. There are too many songs, so it is difficult to guess the clusters in this dense tree. We can see the <emph>trunk of the tree</emph>:</p>

<p>We can assume that there are eight large groups. We'll show one by one to see if we find any relationship between the songs contained in them.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

We can do it better, we can group similar words, we can use bigrams, improve and implement tokenization and other algorithms like tf-idf. We can select weights in the words, e.g. rare words in general but very common in certain songs, to select the songs more similar to others in terms of subject.

I just hope, have contributed a bit with this tribute to one of the great  <emph> Pop </ emph> musicians of our time.
