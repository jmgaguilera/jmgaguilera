My family and my work are my greatest personal projects and I devote most of my time to them. Still, I have developed some things that can be helpful to others.

# 1) Snake Wrangling for Kids (translation to spanish)

Mi translation to spanish of this programming book in Python, which can be read in: [https://github.com/jmgaguilera/swfk-es/releases](https://github.com/jmgaguilera/swfk-es/releases).

The source code of the spanish translation is done in LaTeX and is published in:  [https://github.com/jmgaguilera/swfk-es](https://github.com/jmgaguilera/swfk-es).

"Snake Wrangling for Kids" is an electronic book for children 8 or older who want to learn to program. It covers the basics of programming using Python 3 as the basis for learning the concepts.


The original English version was written by Jason R. Briggs and can be accessed in:
[swfk](http://www.briggs.net.nz/snake-wrangling-for-kids.html).

The Spanish version is made from the English version 0.7.7 using Python 3. From it, some sections have been expanded (indenting and exercises), I added flowcharts to explain the alternative sentences and loops, and added footnotes to explain the meaning of sentences and functions.

Back in 2009, my 9 year old son read the book and tested the clarity of explanations.

Originally translated in 2009 with the permission of the author, in 2015 I migrated the code from code.google to github and corrected some errors that readers had sent me over the years.

Happy reading!
